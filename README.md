#Application Not Responding (ANR) Detection Project
Overview
The Application Not Responding (ANR) Detection Project aims to identify and mitigate instances of ANRs in mobile applications before they are deployed to production. ANRs can significantly impact user experience by causing unresponsive screens, frustrating users, and potentially leading to application crashes.

This project utilizes automated testing techniques, specifically leveraging Appium and random action simulations, to simulate user interactions across the application. By performing these actions, the project aims to trigger ANRs under controlled conditions, allowing developers and testers to detect and address potential issues proactively.
